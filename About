        Hello! I am Callisto, but some of you may know me as SordForAll or Sordgaming. I have been making games for a while now, and recently, I learned Godot and have started working on a few projects.
        As of writing this, I just gave my game to a few playtesters to try it out, so while I wait for feedback I thought it might be a good idea to learn HTML and CSS to make my own website. I've been
        interested in programming ever since I was little. I messed around with Scratch, made a few games, and made a Game Jolt account. None of them ever got popular, but I made a few friends along the way. Eventually I lost 
        interest in Scratch after a few years and I wanted to make better games in a more advanced software, so I experimented with different programs such as Microworlds EX, Unity, Unreal Engine,
        Game Maker, and Godot. I never really found any game engine that stuck with me, so I decided to forget about game development for a few years. During that time, I played Rec Room, and found interest in making Rec Room games. 
        However, I loved watching youtubers such as Dani, Goodgis and pretty much any game dev youtuber, so I decided to get back into game development. I messed around with Unity and Unreal, but I never enjoyed using those programs. 
        Then, I tried Godot again. I absolutely fell in love with Godot, and it is the game engine I'm using now.
